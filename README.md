## How to compile the program

The source is written in C++ and should work with the GNU g++ supporting
`--std=c++14`

Build instructions are provided in `Makefile` file for the GNU make.
To compile the program simply change the current working directory
to the folder with the source code and run make:

    make

If everything goes OK, a single executable should be created:
`ants-tpp`

## Running

The program supports a number of parameters but to run the most basic version
you can enter:

    ./ants-tpp --instance=EEuclideo.350.150.1.tpp --timeout=5

where `--instance=EEuclideo.350.150.1.tpp` is an example path to the U-TPP
instance to solve and `--timeout=5` sets the max computation time.
Results are saved automatically to a file in JSON format.
